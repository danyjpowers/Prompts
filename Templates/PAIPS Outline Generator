PAIPS FRAMEWORK= 1. Address a problem, something your audience can relate to, to stir up an emotional response. 2. Agitate that problem, intensifying the emotional reaction. 3. Just when your audience is on edge, introduce intrigue, something new and shiny to distract and allure. 4. With curiosity piqued, paint a vision of a positive future for the reader, easing the tension. 5. Delivers a solution, triggering a sense of relief and satisfaction.
